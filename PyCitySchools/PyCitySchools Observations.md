PyCitySchools Observations

Observation One:
Schools with higher budgets generally did not provide better test results.


Observation Two:
School size appeared to have an effect on test result, with small to medium schools outperforming lager schools.

Observation Three:
District schools appeared to have lower test results compared to charter schools. However, charter schools had less students compared to district schools, which as indicated in the previous observation appears to have an effect on test results. Further study would be required to understand if it is teaching styles at the schools that truly effect test results.
